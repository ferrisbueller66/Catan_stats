# Catan_stats

This program was created to help people track the most commonly occurring dice rolls in a single game of Catan.
This web application allows a user to create a model representing a game of Catan, that allows a user to record the roll results of each turn. In progress and completed games can both be saved in a user's profile to be used for their own recording keeping.

With this instant knowledge on hand, you'll be able to make more strategic decisions in your games of Catan.
