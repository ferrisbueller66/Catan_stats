## Description

This program was created to help people track the most commonly occurring dice rolls in a single game of Catan.
This web application allows a user to create a model representing a game of Catan, that allows a user to record the roll results of each turn. In progress and completed games can both be saved in a user's profile to be used for their own recording keeping.

With this instant knowledge on hand, you'll be able to make more strategic decisions in your games of Catan.

You can also use [the Catan Stats app here on Heroku.](https://catan-stats.herokuapp.com/)

### Technologies
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Postgresql

## Deploy
---
